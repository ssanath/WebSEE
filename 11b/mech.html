        The department of Mechanical Engineering is a team of well qualified fifty teaching staff members. All the staff
        members have post graduate degrees and eighteen of the staff members are doctorates. The staff members of the
        Mechanical Engineering department have taken up a number of research projects funded by many external agencies
        like DRDO, DST, AICTE, and VTU and have received funding to the tune of Rs. 1 Crore. Faculty members from the
        department have published books in different domains of Mechanical Engineering and these books are recommended
        by the Visvesvaraya Technological Universityâ€™s Board of Studies as reference text books. The department has also
        contributed in developing intellectual property for the institute by obtaining a patent and currently is in
        pursuit of three patents.
